0.2 Second release
  * Now uses _one_ string as a buffer, instead of passing you one back
    after each read(). I had to do this, because the GC couldn't keep
    up. Thanks to the bloke who showed me his example code for this,
    and the ruby-audiofile author, whose idea I eventually used.
    NOTE: This means the API has changed for read() !
  * Put class VorbisFile into module 'Ogg' - so now you need to use
    Ogg::Vorbisfile.
