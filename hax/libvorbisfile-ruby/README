Ruby extension for libvorbisfile.

libvorbisfile is a decoder library provided with the Ogg Vorbis
distribution. See http://xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/ for details.

The API of this extension is virtually identical to that of
vorbisfile.h, with a couple of exceptions:

* Prefixes have been removed (ov_open -> open).
* The OggVorbis_File parameter is removed, as the VorbisFile object
  encapsulates this.

You can read the vorbisfile API at the above URL.

Installation:

./configure
make
make install

Note that you must pass an existing (and opened) IO object to
VorbisFile::open(). This means you are not restricted to files -
reading from (e.g.) a socket is fine.

See test.rb for an example.

Note that Vorbis comments are in UTF-8 and test.rb uses iconv to convert
back to latin-1. Is there a more portable way of doing this ?

Feedback welcome.
