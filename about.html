			<div class="content"><div class="faq">
					<div class="biggest">Welcome to <em>Omploader</em>.  Omploader is a place to put your files, without all the browser clogging junk that you find at most sites.</div>
					<br />
					<div class="big">You can use Omploader any way you like, and there are tools such as the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5638">Firefox extension</a>, or <a href="http://git.omp.am/?p=omploader.git;a=blob;f=ompload;hb=HEAD">a script for omploading files</a>, as well as the web interface you see here.  There are also some third party tools for using Omploader which can be found around the tubes.  Omploader is <strong>anonymous and free</strong> for everyone to use.</div>

					<ol>
						<li><div class="q"><em>Q:</em> Why?</div>
						<div class="a"><em>A:</em> Omploader was <em>originally</em> created to become the ultimate shock site hosting service by Brenden Matthews and David Shakaryan, but has since evolved into much more.  Omploader is written almost entirely in Ruby, which was chosen for no particular reason (actually David was a Ruby fanboy, and Brenden didn't care).  All of the omploader code is available from the git repository (see footer).</div></li>
						<li><div class="q"><em>Q:</em> Are there any restrictions or limits on content?</div>
						<div class="a"><em>A:</em> There is a 1 GiB file size restriction, and there are no restrictions on content.  However, we retain the right to delete whatever the crap we feel like if we find it offensive, irritating, lame, wasteful, or whatever.</div></li>
						<li><div class="q"><em>Q:</em> Why is it when I use omploader as a free image hosting service I get a nasty image?</div>
						<div class="a"><em>A:</em> Omploader will remain free as in <strong>FREEDOM</strong>, for as long as possible.  However, we don't appreciate when people use omploader on their high traffic sites instead of using their own damn servers (<strong>especially</strong> if they have ads on their site).  <a href="http://omploader.org/rewrites.txt">Here is what our rewrite list looks like</a>.  Also, if we just plain don't like your site's content we may add your site to the rewrite list.  As of May/2009, google ads were added to deal with growing bandwidth and server costs.</div></li>
